\maketitle

In this method the input data sequence is split into blocks of length $N$ samples defined by $N=L+R-1$. Each successive blocks of length $N$ consist of overlapping last $R-1$ samples of the previous block followed by $R$ new samples. Then, the an $N$-point FFT is computed for each data block. Then, the multiplication of $N$-point FFT and the transfer function is performed. Since the data block is of length $N$, the first $R-1$ samples of the output are corrupt by the aliasing. Thus, these initial samples are then discarded, and only the error-free $N-(R-1)$ samples are saved in the output record.
It is important to emphasize that in the beginning of processing the first $R-1$ zeros are set to zero
In the figure below is presented an example of overlap-add method with $R=\frac{N}{2}$ and $L=R$.
