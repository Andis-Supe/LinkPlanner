\section{Functional Description}
	
MQAM system is composed of four blocks: a transmitter, a receiver, a communication channel and a block that performs a Bit Error Rate (BER) measurement. The schematic representation of the system is presented in figure \ref{MQAM_system_block_diagram}.

%\subsection*{MQAM transmitter}
%
%A complete description of the MQAM transmitter either block by block or as a whole can be found in the \textit{lib} repository. 
%
%This block generates one optical signal. It can also output the binary signal that is used to perform a BER measurement.
%
%\subsection*{Communication channel}
%
%The communication channel has only thermal noise.
%
%\subsection*{MQAM receiver}
%
%The MQAM receiver is a homodyne receiver.
