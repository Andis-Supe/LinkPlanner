{\bf Quantum Noise implementation}\\
In the simulation, each arm's photocurrent ($I_3$ and $I_4$) is modelled as the output of the photodiode's conversion of optical power. This incident optical power follows the photon number statistics, scaled by the power of a single photon. The final current, $I_{34}$, will be simply the difference between the photocurrents of both arms.
We start by calculating the expected value and variace of the photon number given by $\hat{n}_3$:
%
\begin{equation}
\braket{\hat{n}_3} = \frac{1}{2} \left( |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 + 2 \cos(\phi_\alpha - \phi_\beta) \right)
\qquad
\qquad
\textrm{Var}(\hat{n}_3) = \braket{\hat{n}_3}
\end{equation}
%
If we calculate the expected value and variance for $\hat{n}_4$, the resulting values will be $\textrm{Var}(\hat{n}_4) = \braket{\hat{n}_4}$. Therefore both photon statistics can be modelled by Poisson distributions:
%
\begin{equation}
n_i \sim \textrm{Poisson}(\braket{n_i})
\end{equation}
%
In the simulation, a photodiode has 2 inputs. Each input corresponds to a mean complex amplitude $\bar{\Psi}_i$. This amplitude corresponds to the power $\bar{P}_i = |\bar{\Psi}_i|^2 = \braket{n_i}P_\lambda$ in which $P_\lambda$ is the power of a single photon. What we want is the power after adding noise, $P_i = n_i P_\lambda$. To model $n_i$, we will use a gaussian aproximation of $\sqrt{n_i}$, for $n_i \gg 0$, which will give us a continuous distribution:
%
\begin{equation}
\sqrt{n_i} \sim \textrm{Gaussian}(\sqrt{\braket{n_i}}, 1/2)
\end{equation}
%
Therefore:
%
\begin{equation}
n_i \approx \left( \sqrt{\braket{n_i}} + \frac{1}{2}G \right)^2 = \braket{n_i} + \sqrt{\braket{n_i}} G + \frac{1}{4} G^2
\end{equation}
%
in which $G$ is a random variable with a gaussian distribution with mean $0$ and variance $1$.\\
Therefore, the output power of each becomes:
%
\begin{equation}
P_i = n_i P_\lambda = \bar{P}_i + \sqrt{P_\lambda \bar{P}} G + \frac{1}{4} P_\lambda G^2
\end{equation}
%
\\

{\bf Thermal Noise Implementation}\\
In the experimental setting, it is assumed that this noise is created by the detection system. To simulate this noise, the photodiode will add it to the output current as a simple gaussian distribution with mean $0$ and variance according to experimental settings.\\
