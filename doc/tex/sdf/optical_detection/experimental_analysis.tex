\subsection{Experimental Analysis}
%
In this section, we will test experimentally the setups discussed in section \ref{subsec:intro}.
%
This comparison between the theoretical and experimental results will require a high degree of precision from the devices used in these setups. Therefore, the correct characterization of these devices must be the starting point of this experimental phase.
One of the most fundamental components is the photodetector, which performs the signal's conversion from the optical domain into the electrical domain.
%
\subsubsection{Thorlabs detector}
%
The detector used in the laboratory is the Thorlabs PDB 450C. This detector consists of two well-matched photodiodes and a transimpedance amplifier that generates an output voltage (RF OUTPUT) proportional to the difference between the photocurrents of the photodiodes.\\
Additionally, the unit has two monitor outputs (MONITOR+ and MONITOR-) to observe the optical input power level on each photodiode separately.

\end{figure}
%
\noindent
Figure \ref{fig:photodetector-circuit} shows a functional block diagram of the photodetector, in which the TIA (transimpedance amplifier) is an opamp-based current to voltage conversion amplifier.
In contrast to the photodiode's non-linear voltage response to incident light, it's current response is linear.
%\footnote{http://www.ti.com/lit/an/sboa035/sboa035.pdf, p.1}.
To take advantage of this linear response, the TIA is used to perform the conversion of the difference of currents between the two photodiodes into a voltage proportional to that same difference.

Various of those parameters can be readly extracted from the device's manual, which are presented in the following tables and plots.\\

\subsubsection{Data analysis}
%
For each configuration of amplitude and frequency of the input signal, the photodetector output voltage is collected by the Digital Oscilloscope during a time interval and saved in a data file. The data consists on a sequence of pulses and it's analysis will be focused on the samples with equal phase. The steps will be the following
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item For each phase value, the average and variance of the samples with the same phase is calculated;
\item The representative amplitude and variance for the present configuration will be the obtained from the middle of the maximum plateau.
\end{enumerate}
%
%
%
%
To confirm the theoretical results obtained in section \ref{subsec:intro}, two experimental setups will be created. In the first experiement, we will study quantum noise in the single homodyne detection. The experimental setup will be based on the paper \cite{chi2011balanced}. In the second experiment, we will study quantum noise in the double homodyne detection setup, which will be basically an extension of the single homodyne detection setup.\\
\\
\subsubsection{Single homodyne detection}
%
To keep the experiment simple and avoid extra sources of noise, we will avoid using black boxes wich have complicated inner workings, having a preference in using simple components, as shown in fig. \ref{fig:experimental_homodyne_setup}:

A single laser is splitted and used as the source for the signal (S) and the local oscillator (LO). The signal beam is pulsed and highly attenuated. The local oscillator is also attenuaded, but not pulsed. The signal and local oscillator interfere in a Beam Splitter originating two beams which are then converted to voltages in the PIN. These voltages are read in the Digital Oscilator (OSC) and collect in the computer. In the post processing phase, the quantum noise is measured by applying a difference between the two beams and measuring it's variance.
\\
The second stage of the experiment will be very similar to the first one, in which the signal and local oscillator branches will be divided. One of the new branches of the local oscilator will suffer a phase delay of $\pi/2$, in order to measure the quadrature component of the incoming signal.\\

\subsection{Comparative analysis}
%
%WARNING -- OLD DATA --\\
%
Given the theoretical, simulated and experimental frameworks, we will now compare the results obtained by each of them.

	\end{subfigure}
	\captionsetup{justification=centering}
	\caption{Noise variance dependency with local oscilator power for two different quadratures. Experimental vs fitted data.}
\end{figure}
%
Figures $\ref{fig:noise-exp-1}$ and $\ref{fig:noise-exp-3}$ show measurements of total noise for two different quadratures. For low power of LO, the noise variance flutuates around a constant value. For high power of LO, $(P_{LO}>10^{-4}W)$, the variance of noise shows an increasing trend roughly proportional to $P_{LO}^2$. The polynomial fittings confirm this trend, showing a degree 2 coefficient much larger than the degree 1 coefficient
%
\begin{equation}
\textrm{Var}_X = 2.22 \!\! \times \!\! 10^{-5} + 9.6 \!\! \times \!\! 10^{-3} P_{LO} + 3.40 P_{LO}^2
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\textrm{Var}_Y = 2.71 \!\! \times \!\! 10^{-5} + 8.9 \!\! \times \!\! 10^{-3} P_{LO} + 7.25 P_{LO}^2
\end{equation}
%
The expected growth should be proportional to $P_{LO}$, but the RIN noise, originated by the electric apparatus, which grows quadratically with the power, is dominating the noise amplitude for large $P_{LO}$.\\
We see that both the simulation and experimental data display a similar behaviour, but the quadratic growth of noise for large $P_{LO}$ was not predicted in the simulations.\\
